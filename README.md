# Calculator
Refactored and remade.
# Building
```
$ git clone https://github.com/linuxnoodle/calculator
$ cd calculator/
$ make clean calculator
$ ./calculator
```
# TODO:
- [X] Implement lexing of user input. (Currently done with shoddily with regex, possibly reimplement without it?)
- [X] Implement basic math operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
- [ ] Implement order of operations.
- [ ] Implement more complex operations. (SQRT, NTH ROOT, Expanding, Factoring, Trig Functions, Zeros (Newton's method), etc.)
- [ ] Windows support (should mainly work so far)
- [ ] (Unlikely) Add a method to graph functions.
